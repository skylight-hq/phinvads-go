1. Describe (Outer function, explains whole feature/capability)
2. Context (Explains the specifications of a certain situation)
3. Given/When/Then (Describes the steps a user takes interacting with the application)

Describe: Reading code systems from the application
    Context 1:
        Given the service is populated with data
        AND the server is running

        Context 1A:
            Given a valid user
            AND has access to the api
        
            Test:
                When I get the code systems index endpoint
                Then Status Code 200
                AND Response body contains multiple code systems

            Test:
                When I GET an endpoint that does not exist
                Then Status Code 400

            Test:
                When I get the code systems index by OID endpoint using a valid OID
                Then Status Code 200
                AND Response Body contains the desired code system

            Test:
                When I get the code systems index by OID endpoint using a invalid OID
                Then Status Code 400
